You come out from the hotel and you can ski straight away. Ski rental,ski instructors and ski passes are there for you from 9am to 22pm. The reception desk will guide you want to do and where to go. Hotel has also,a ski storage facility free of charge. 2- Thermal- after all day ski, you can relax in Thermas pools which is fantastic, for your sore muscels. I loved all the saunas too. 3 - Kids- there is no better place, if you want to come with kids. You want them to learn ski or swim - no problem. There is a kitchenet on every floor, in case you need to reheat the food for your toddlers. 4- Large, comfortable and clean rooms. You can make a tea and coffee, which is a big plus.

We found the staff friendly, helpful and happy; the facilities at the hotel were brilliant and there was always something to do for the kids meaning as parents we could relax. Also the access to the slopes, ski school and ski hire was exceptional! Even if the slopes got crowded at time’s (school holidays) it was brilliant being able to walk into the hotel for breaks in between ski sessions. Big thank you to the ladies at the kids club who’s tireless energy, smiles and games meant our two kept coming back and never wanted to leave!

Got the feeling staff badly treated by management and not very motivated. Also large part of our crowd drink and hotel bar closed religiously at 23.00. If you are lucky you well get into nightclub for further drinks. Unfortunately it was difficult to get into as door staff very awkward until we showed them our Bania watch.
