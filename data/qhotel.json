We were a family of 4 and they gave us 2 interconnecting rooms, which was a plus for us. Hotel and rooms are modern and clean, including the bathrooms, which also that had spacious walk-in showers. It must be mentioned that the hotel has its own restaurant serving fantastic quality food. We had lunch there when we arrived, but the quality of the food was so good that we ended up having dinner there as well. I'm a bit surprised that this restaurant isn't included in Trip Advisor.

Very modern and well kept hotel, with very nice rooms and nice and firm beds. Had breakfast there once, which was nice but expensive for what it was so we found alternative arrangements. There were a few new building teething issues while we were there, but resolved with minimum fuss. Staff v friendly and hotel in great location for transport as there is a tram stop right outside the front door. This does make it quite noisy here if you feel the need to open a window, but to be expected in a city break!
