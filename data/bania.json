Hotel has also,a ski storage facility free of charge. 2- Thermal- after all day ski, you can relax in Thermas pools which is fantastic, for your sore muscels. I loved all the saunas too. 3 - Kids- there is no better place, if you want to come with kids. You want them to learn ski or swim - no problem. There is a kitchenet on every floor, in case you need to reheat the food for your toddlers. 4- Large, comfortable and clean rooms. You can make a tea and coffee, which is a big plus.
